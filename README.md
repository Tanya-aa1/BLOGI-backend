# Blogi 
-Platform for bloggers to create and share their content with the world.

## Overview

This project is a dockerized backend project for a blogging platform called Blogi, built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. It fulfills the core assignment objectives, including:

- User registration and login with JWT authentication
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting personal blog posts
- Viewing a list of all blog posts sorted by most recent posts
- Secure interaction with a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM
- RESTful API architecture with proper error handling
- Support for uploading images to blog posts
- Pagination for the list of all posts
- Searching a blog post by its title/ content
- Dockerized with wait-for-db handling



## Features

1. User Authentication
   
   - User registration with a unique username and password
   - Hashing of passwords for security
   - Login and returning a JWT token for protected endpoints
   - Tokens secured using PyJWT with expiration
     
2. Blog Post Management
   
   - Create Post -- Authenticated users can create blog posts with title and content
   - Read Posts  -- Retrieve personal posts
                 -- View all blog posts sorted by most recent
   - Update/Delete ‚Äî Authenticated users can update or delete only their own posts

3. Use PostgreSQL as the database for storing users and blog posts

4. Implemented error handling for all routes

5. **BONUS FEATURES**

   A. Search blog posts by keywords in title or content

   B. Pagination for blog listing

   C. Image upload support while creating a blog
   
   D. Dockerized development environment
   


## Libraries Used

- `FastAPI` - Web framework
- `SQLAlchemy` - ORM
- `Uvicorn` - ASGI server
- `Passlib` - Password hashing
- `PyJWT` - JWT token handling
- `python-dotenv` - Load environment variables

## Database Schema
The application uses a PostgreSQL database with the following two primary tables:

1. users
   - id	
   - username	
   - password
   - posts (relationship)

2. posts
   - id	
   - title	
   - content	
   - created_at	
   - updated_at
   - user_id
   - image_url
   - author (relationship)

## API Endpoints

> Base URL: `http://localhost:8000`

  POST- /register   - Register a new user 
  POST- /login      - Authenticate user and get token 
  GET - /me         - Getting the current user
  GET - /blogs      - Get all blogs (supports pagination & search) 
  GET - /blogs/{id} - Get a single blog post 
  POST- /blogs      - Create a blog post (auth required) 
  PUT - /blogs/{id} - Update a blog post (auth required)

##  How to Run the Project

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & Docker Compose installed
- Clone this repo

### üìÅ Setup `.env` File

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and fill it like this:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/blogdb
SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
```
Run with Docker

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build
Your FastAPI app will be available at:
üìç http://localhost:8000/docs ‚Üê for Swagger UI

Installing Dependencies (for local dev without Docker)
If you want to run without Docker:


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure PostgreSQL is installed locally and running. Update your .env accordingly.

Common Issues Encountered
Issue	Fix
FastAPI starts before PostgreSQL is ready	Fixed using wait-for-db.sh script
Environment variables not loading	Ensure .env is present and correct
CORS errors in frontend	Add CORS middleware in FastAPI if needed
Connection refused to DB	Check if db service is up, and Docker network is working properly
